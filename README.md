## Usage

The package installs the commands `html-outliner:show-outline`, which open a drawer panel with the two outlines of the HTML document, using `html 4` and `html 5` specs.

### Notes

The `html 5` outline is generated by the [h5o npm package](https://h5o.github.io).

The `html 4` outline is generated by the [??? npm package](#TODO).

## Keybindings

With the success of Atom, it's really difficult to choose keybindings that will not enter in conflict whit anyone else's packages, so I let the keymap empty, allowing you to set your own keybindings.
