## Usage

The package installs the commands `html-outliner:show-outline`, which open a drawer panel with the two outlines of the HTML document.

### Notes

The `HTML5 Outline` outline is generated by the [h5o npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/h5o).

The `Headings Outline` outline is generated by the [easy-outliner npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/easy-outliner).

## Keybindings

With the success of Atom, it's really difficult to choose keybindings that will not enter in conflict whit anyone else's packages, so I let the keymap empty, allowing you to set your own keybindings.
